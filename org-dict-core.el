  "Select DOM node given CSS attribute/combinator SELECTOR.

A SELECTOR has the following syntax: 
<selector> := '(<simple_selector> <combinator_selector>...)
<simple_selector> := '(:tag <tag> :attrs <attributes>) 
<combinator_selector> := '(<combinator> <simple_selector>)
where
<tag> is a symbol
<combinator> is one of '=>, '>, '+, '~
<attributes> is an alist of key (symbol) value (string)

Simple selectors:
- 'e' corresponds to '(:tag e)
- '#myid' corresponds to '(:attrs ((id . \"myid\")))
- '.myclass' corresponds to '(:attrs ((class . \"myclass\")))

Attribute selectors (only e[key] and e[key~=value] is supported):
- '[key]', corresponds to (:attrs ((key)))
- 'e[key]', corresponds to (:tag e :attrs ((key)))
- 'e[key~=\"value\"]', corresponds to (:tag e :attrs ((key . \"value\")))
- 'e#myid', which is equivalent to 'e[id~=myid]', corresponds to 
  '(:tag e :attrs ((id . \"myid\"))).
- 'e.class1.class2', which is equivalent to 'e[class~=class1][class~=class2]',
  corresponds to '(:tag e :attrs ((class . \"class1 class2\"))).

Combinator selectors (space, >, +, ~ combinators are supported):
- 'e1 e2' corresponds to '(=> e1 e2)
- 'e1 > e2' corresponds to '(> e1 e2)
- 'e1 + e2' corresponds to '(+ e1 e2)
- 'e1 ~ e2' corresponds to '(~ e1 e2)

Besides, selectors are composable, e.g. 'ul > li#selected + li > a' corresponds 
to 
   '((:tag ul)
    (> (:tag li :attrs ((id \"selected\"))))
    (+ (:tag li))
    (> (:tag a)))
